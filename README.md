# clear-clutter
This Node.js script organizes files in a directory by grouping them into subfolders based on their extensions. It dynamically detects file types, creates folders named after each extension (e.g., `txt` for `.txt` files), and moves files into the appropriate folders. Files without extensions are ignored, ensuring a neat, organized structure.
